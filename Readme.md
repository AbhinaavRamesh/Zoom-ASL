## Key Features

* Pin and Spotlight to place a sign language interpreter alongside the presenter.
  - Instantly see the translation of ASL to English text.

* Pose Detection + Palm Landmark detection: Trained with WLASL (Word-level ASL) 100 Class (Scalable to 1000*) processed dataset. Data pipeline flows from Pose detection output, mapping skeleton point locations as a unique signature for glossary of signs

* Convolutional Neural Network (MS-ALS): Spatial data load, Temporal Load (Optic Flow Computer Vision Library), and Fusion Model. Trained with custom captured Sign language data for 6 classes (Short video clips).

* ML-API for Speech to Text and Text to speech to facilitate end to end User Experience for the application

* NLP based pre-trained framework to generate sentences based on sign language keywords    

* Efficient Streaming solutions to establish Video Endpoints using webcams through local Sockets and Web Sockets.
